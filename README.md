# numpy-random-assignment
###### Jonathan Harper

###### I wanted to create a Jupyter notebook that I could use as a simple reference myself going forward and hopefully build upon as I learn more about the NumPy package beyond the NumPy.random package that forms the basis of this assignment. This is the main reason for my opening section of <em>"What is NumPy?"</em>. As my understanding of the package increases I will return to this section but initially it is there as an opening section to the assignment. Until the assinment is completed it will be commited to only in respect to a simple overview. Nonetheless the small intro is a usefull read (for me) before diving into the .random aspects in particular.
